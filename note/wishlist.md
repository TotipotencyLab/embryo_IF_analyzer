# Wishlist features

- Watershed for nuclear detection (and for future deferred particle detection)
- `z_process`: make z-projection of each image, then save to a small file. Optionally overlay with ROI (e.g., detected nucleus)
- Groovy study scripts:
  - A script for image metadata inspection (how many series it contains, dimension of each (x,y,z), etc.)
  - A script that inspect the current GUI session - what is currently opened, how many window, working with ROI, etc.
- Introduce sample table (TSV) and config (YAML)

This means the Groovy scripts may have to defined into different levels:
- lowest level: utility function - for small individual step
- interactive session macro: the script that can be run on the current active image window. 
- High throughput analysis: This is the one that is based on the sample table and the config. This can be run headlessly in principle.
